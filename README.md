The aim of this project is to re-create the famous RType arcade game in C++ and implement client-server architecture with multi-player mode. A modular game engine was to be developed, with content creation tools. Possibility of a single-player mode with AI. The project imposes professional rigor in both the design and writing of the code, and the optimization of client-server communication. The game's performance is up to the highest standards.
